This project extends on the 'PsyLog' platform \cite{faelles}.
The purpose of this project is to prepare for experiments that examines a possible connection between non-intrusive and intrusive data.
This is done with data collected from the mobile devices of patients that have been diagnosed with an affective disorder, specifically regarding their social activity.

Intrusive data will be collected through surveying the patient, regarding his own perception of his current state, through notifications on the phone.

Non-intrusive data will be collected by sensors on the phone and logging social activity through SMS, calls and the like.

By collecting data from both, intrusive and non-intrusive, it should be possible in the future to say something about the validity of the non-intrusive data.

The report concludes by discussing how the developed modules can be used to conduct the experiment in the future.

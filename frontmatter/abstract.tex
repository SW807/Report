This project extends on the 'PsyLog - mobile platform'\cite{faelles}.
The purpose of this project is to prepare for an experiment which examines if there is a connection between non-intrusive and intrusive data collected from  mobile phone of patients that have been diagnosed with an affective disorder, specifically regarding their social activity.

Intrusive data will be collected through surveying the patient of his perception of his state with notifications on the phone.

Non-intrusive data will be collected by sensors on the phone and logging social activity through SMS, calls and the like.

By collecting data from both, intrusive and non-intrusive, it should be possible in the future to say something about the non-intrusive data.

The report will conclude by discussing how the developed modules can be used to conduct the experiment in the future.
